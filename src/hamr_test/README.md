## hamr_test  
This is a preliminary package for HAMR where I defined:  
1) Initial intuitions for custom msgs to be sent over custom topics (subject to change)  
2) A test suite for debugging the HAMR, including a basic interface for writing specific velocities to each motor and updating PID on command. This suite will soon include live-plotting the velocities (both sensed and desired) with respect to time.
